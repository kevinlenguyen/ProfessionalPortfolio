# Professional Portfolio
My name is Kevin Nguyen and this is my portfolio of assignments and projects that demonstrate my critical thinking and technical skills as an undergraduate Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Washington.

## Mechanics of Materials Formal Lab Reports 
This folder includes 2 formal lab reports on torsion and digital image correlation. These lab reports demonstrate my ability to analyze and compare experimental data to theoretical values, formulate arguments based on measurement statistics and data, evaluate sources of error, and overall create professional level scientific papers.

## SolidWorks
This folder is for my final project for ME123: Visualization & CAD. My final project was a marble machine complete with part files, an assembly file, an exploded view drawing, a detailed drawing, an image in PhotoView360, and a motion test. This project demonstrates my mastery of basic skills in SolidWorks such as creating parts, assembling parts and utilizing mates, and generating product deliverables.

## Technical Writing
This folder includes a memorandum, an engineering team report, and a professional poster for my ENGR231: Introduction to Technical Writing class. The memorandum demonstrates my ability to research and gain mastery over a topic outside of my scope of knowledge. The professional poster demonstrates my ability to deliver complex information in a clear and concise manner for stakeholders. The engineering team report demonstrates my ability to research, work in a team, identify stakeholders, consider ethical dilemmas,  create innovative solutions, and generate professional product deliverables. 

## Mechanical Design
This folder includes my 40-page technical report dedicated to my ME395: Introduction to Mechanical Design final project that spanned over 6 weeks. In addition, various model views for my final project are provided.

The objective of this project is to design a new waste disposal system that can be used on a single family level with minimal energy and cost. The toilet should be capable of: (1) rendering bodily wastes of an adult human into water, CO2, and mineral ash, (2) at a per capita daily total cost not to exceed $0.07, (3) in a safe, enduring, and environmentally satisfactory manner. However, the waste disposal system must have unqualified freedom from inputted water and output sewerage connections of any type and operate on single-day time scales. Secondary objectives include: sustained operation without any external utilities (i.e. grid power, natural gas pipeline), conversion of recovered water into potable-grade water, proper lighting, and freedom from insects, odors, stains, or unhygienic surfaces.

Skills and I learned from this project: preliminary project planning, assessing client needs, concept generation, concept selection, risk analysis, economic analysis, group dynamics.
